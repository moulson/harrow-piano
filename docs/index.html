                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a professional piano teacher with a decade of experience. I have a huge passion for music, dancing and helping young talents to fulfil their potentials. 
                    I love teaching young children to appreciate classical music and prepare for their ABRSM exams. 
                    I would love to go on the journey with more children and make a difference to the world through the love of music!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lessons will be focus on the basics of piano technique, posture, hand position, the ability to read music notation, listening and aural skills, musicality and expression. 
                    These will provide the foundation for a life long adventure in piano playing. Most importantly, music is about having fun and being able to open up to the adventure that music can communicate to us.

                    My lessons are completely flexible and tailored to each student's individual needs.
                    Students can decide the frequency and length of the lessons. Typically it's recommended for students to have weekly lessons with the length of lessons increasing with ability or when preparing for examinations.
